# Explain-Rewrite-AI-for-webpages
This is an AI-powered Firefox browser extension that utilizes the GPT-4 Mini API to explain or rewrite selected text on webpages. An OpenAI API key is required for the proper functioning of this extension. It is completely open-source, and you are welcome to modify it as needed.

If you're unsure how to use it, look up instructions on how to sideload a custom extension for the Firefox browser. I plan to add more features to this extension in the future.
